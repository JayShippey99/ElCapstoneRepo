||||||||||||| Intro

So...
This is the lab
Make yourself at home
This place is cool -> int2
Very interesting -> int2
Shortcut to choice -> s4.7

||| int2
This is where I go when people
can't seem to get a hold of me
The radio signals are very... filtered here
So you needed my help, but why me? -> int3

||| int3
Well
From what I've seen,
you just fit the bill
Right... -> int4
Thanks, I guess -> int4

||| int4
Look
You're the only person that I trust
I'll prove it
Lemme get this thing on
... -> end section

That never gets old to me haha
Hey that's a tesseract! -> rs2
What is that thing? -> rs2

||| rs2
A tesseract, yes
It's a 4th dimensional cube
Some call it a hypercube
How did you do that? -> rs3

||| rs3
Well, that's actually why I needed
someone I can trust
What do you mean? -> rs4

||| rs4
I mean
I didn't do this
THIS, isn't from... here
What does that mean exactly? -> rs5

||| rs5
It means
Not from Earth
Aliens? -> rs6
I'm still confused -> rs6

||| rs6
I know I know I'm sure it sounds insane
But this tesseract, it has the potential
to bridge communication between us and the aliens!
So it is aliens... -> rs7
That's a lot to take in -> rs7

||| rs7
I need your help
We don't know WHERE it came from
And we don't know WHY it came here
I can't do this alone
Why not? -> rs8
Sounds scary -> rs8

||| rs8
I can't manage all of
this equipment by myself
Well why is it set up this way? -> rs9

||| rs9
That
Is a long story that I will happily get into
But for now, I need to explain the rules to you
Fine -> end section
Okay -> end section


||||||||||||| tutorial

This is the tesseract
It is entirely made of quantum fields
Okay -> t1

||| t1
This machine controls the rotation of the tesseract
Pressing this button activates the side closest to us
Okay -> t2

||| t2
If you pull these dials left and right
you can navigate to the other sides
Okay -> t3

||| t3
Now, before I continue
This is the part where I come into play
Watch this
... Okay? -> end section
Watching -> end section


||||||||||||| tutorial2

With the correct circumstances
We can open up the tesseract
Interesting -> tt2

||| tt2
From what I can tell, that's space
But that's all I can really gather
I haven't been able to investigate it much alone
How so? -> tt3

||| tt3
My equipment is over here
Your equipment is over there
My arms are only so long
Fair enough -> tt4

||| tt4
Anyways
You know how you're the top student
in my quantum particle lectures?
I guess I'm alright -> tt5
Yeah? -> tt5

||| tt5
By studying the tesseract
We've discovered two new particles
Really? -> tt6
Who's this 'we' you keep mentioning? -> tt6

||| tt6
I'll get to that later!
Fine, fine -> tt7

||| tt7
This machine
Lets you load up a series of particles
By pressing the buttons under each screen
Okay -> tt9

||| tt9
Pressing this button here
will create a cluster particle
Which is then fired at the tesseract
Okay -> tt10

||| tt10
This screen shows you what the cluster
looks like when you're sending it
Okay -> tt11

||| tt11
Each side has its own properties
and requires increasing amounts of energy
Okay -> tt11.5

||| tt11.5
Pulling this lever
Safely kills the energy levels
That are temporarily being stored
Okay -> tt12

||| tt12
Oh!
Lastly, to your left is a corkboard
I see -> tt12.5

||| tt12.5
I'll be pinning important things to that
every now and then
Thanks -> tt13

||| tt13
When you're ready
activate the side I opened up
and start experimenting
... I'm really not sure what to expect
Here goes nothing -> end section


||||||||||||| side1

Woah!
What did I do? -> s1.01

||| s1.01
Something good!
I'll say that much!
Wow! 
Did you hear that? -> s1.02

||| s1.02
Yeah I heard that
But do you see that!
But this is a galaxy!
Wow, this is amazing -> s1.03
But what does it mean? -> s1.03

||| s1.03
This must've been the calibration test!
And not only that but I can
probably track down that galaxy
Awesome! -> s1.04

||| s1.04
...
Sure enough
I found the coordinates
We are coming, aliens -> s1.05

||| s1.05
... Well
I'm glad I have you aboard
That was amazing
Wasn't too hard -> s1.1
Thanks -> s1.1

||| s1.1
While you were doing that
I was able to take some notes
and this is incredible progress
What did you learn -> s1.2

||| s1.2
Well, we both saw the weird path
that you were making
It was like completing a circuit
I noticed that too -> s1.3
Yeah that's interesting -> s1.3

||| s1.3
And when the circuit was completed
I noticed that the energy levels
went higher
Okay -> s1.4

||| s1.4
And this symbol at the end...
The sound we heard...
Wait a minute...
I think they might've been right
Who? -> s1.5

||| s1.5
An old colleague
... I had many old colleagues
What happened to them? -> s1.6

||| s1.6
Well... I don't know!
At all!
They just disappeared one by one!
Really? -> s1.8
I still feel like I'm missing something -> s1.8

||| s1.8
I used to work for NASA
I've shared this with the class many times
Right... -> s1.9

||| s1.9
But I've never told anyone
about what I did after working there
What happened? -> s1.10

||| s1.10
Well to start, 
my entire department got laid off
But little did they know that they disposed
of a team of goddamn geniuses
... -> s1.11

||| s1.11
This facility was made by US
We did our OWN independant research
You created this place? -> s1.12

||| s1.12
We created the technology required
to find the tesseract in space
and bring it down to Earth
If anything we were held back at that institution
I see -> s1.13
So what happened to everyone? -> s1.13

||| s1.13
Well, I'm worried that the government
caught on to us
To put it one way...
Oh... -> s1.14

||| s1.14
His name was Tim
The person I mentioned earlier
He had this theory that I have to test
... One second
Okay -> s1.15

||| s1.15
That smart bastard was right!
Running the signals we just heard
through a spectrogram gives us an image!
I'll put it up on the corkboard for you
Can't wait! -> s1.16

||| s1.16
I think this is a structure
for another new particle!
Really?! -> s1.17
Sure looks like it -> s1.17

||| s1.17
Okay give me one sec to hack
into your machine
I'm going to add this new one
This is so exciting! -> s1.18
Are we sure its stable? -> s1.18

||| s1.18
This is guaranteed to work
Math doesn't lie
Here it goes
Agreed -> end section


||||||||||||| side2

This just keeps getting better and better
That's a star map!
It's like we're zooming in on
The galaxy we found earlier
Star map? -> s2.01

||| s2.01
Its an indicator of 
pulse patterns of the neighboring stars
like triangulation
Can you track this star down? -> s2.02

||| s2.02
I should be able to if I just plug
the numbers in
Makes sense -> s2.03

||| s2.03
AHA!
I found it
Let's keep this in mind but keep
Digging deeper
Okay -> s2.04

||| s2.04
I'm also going to check
what the sound gave us this time
Okay -> s2.1

||| s2.1
Oh cool!
Its another particle
This one looks interesting
Show me! -> s2.2

||| s2.2
I've pinned it up on the corkboard
Gosh, the crew would've loved this
At least there's someone to share this with
I'm glad you brought me in to help -> s2.3

||| s2.3
You were always a stand out student to me
Thanks -> s2.4
... -> s2.4

||| s2.4
I admit, this is incredibly stupid...
If word about this facility gets out
I 'll be gone just like my friends
Do you understand?
You have my word -> s2.5
Yes -> s2.5

||| s2.5
Not only that
But all this work
will have been for nothing
And that's no good
I understand -> s2.6

||| s2.6
Anyways
I'm accessing your machine again
to add this new particle
Roger that -> end section


||||||||||||| side3

Well done!
A solar system!
We keep getting closer to something
Agreed -> s3.01

||| s3.01
Its a rather small one
There's only 3 planets
That happens right? -> s3.02

||| s3.02
Its more common to have a small
amount of planets actually
We're incredibly lucky here
Cool -> s3.03

||| s3.03
This is super exciting
How are you feeling?
This is really cool! -> s3.05
It's a little spooky -> s3.05

||| s3.05
I wil admit
I still am not sure what this
is leading to
Right -> s3.06

||| s3.06
But I can't help but dig deeper
Speaking of digging deeper
These are starting to look more complex
Are you keeping up fine?
Yeah -> s3.1
Eh -> s3.1

||| s3.1
I imagine its only going to get more
difficult as we go
But I know you can do it
Thanks -> s3.7

||| s3.7
I'm looking at an energy reading...
These energy levels are really
starting to get up there
...
Should we be concerned? -> s3.8

||| s3.8
Not yet
But I can't totally say what will happen
Once we get past the breaking point
Breaking point? -> s3.9

||| s3.9
I mean
This place can withstand what we expected
And we've already had two new discoveries
I see... -> s3.10

||| s3.10
Don't be anxious
I won't let things get out of control
Okay -> s3.11

||| s3.11
... Oh I totally forgot to check
with the spectrogram
One sec...
Okay -> s3.12

||| s3.12
That son of a bitch
Well this is a different son of a bitch
What's going on? -> s3.13

||| s3.13
Garret was the one who made
the machines on your desk
He was very proactive
Made a lot more machines than needed
And? -> s3.14

||| s3.14
He predicted that there might be
an additional component we'd control
This time controlling particle rotation 
What does this mean for me? -> s3.15

||| s3.15
Great question
First
Let me add this new image to the board
Okay -> s3.16

||| s3.16
And now
I'll set up the machine and then explain it
Sounds good -> end section


||||||||||||| side4

Is that...
There's a person -> s4.1

||| s4.1
Yeah there absolutely is
... Wow
That looks like two planets
And the one with the person is whole
What do you make of that? -> s4.2

||| s4.2
Firstly, I'm floored
I wasn't expecting direct mention
of humans
... -> s4.3

||| s4.3
Secondly
It looks like this planet needs
humans to survive
for whatever reason
Its probably the alien planet -> s4.4

||| s4.4
That would make a lot of sense since
we've been zooming in on them
... I'm beginning to worry 
Why? -> s4.5
Me too -> s4.5

||| s4.5
I need to keep digging deeper
I need to finish up this
project for my team
But...
... -> s4.6

||| s4.6
Why us?
I get what you mean -> s4.7
... -> s4.7

||| s4.7
From a species that can harness
the 4th dimension
What do we have to offer?
Intelligence? -> s4.8
Humanity? -> s4.8
Help? -> s4.8

||| s4.8
I mean maybe
Seems unlikely though
... -> s4.9

||| s4.9
I can't dwell on this for long
I'll just get a migraine
Lemme check the sound visualizer
Okay -> s4.10
Haha okay -> s4.10

||| s4.10
... Ha!
He did it again
We need another machine
What is it? -> s4.11

||| s4.11
This one uses soundwaves to
artificially create gravity
Oh cool! -> s4.12

||| s4.12
I added it to the corkboard
And I'm also going to
set up the new equipment
Go ahead -> end section


||||||||||||| side5

This is...
A wormhole?
But I can't tell what its showing us
I'm drawing a blank too -> s5.1

||| s5.1
Huh...
In the meantime I'll scan the sound
and see what we get
Okay -> s5.2

||| s5.2
... What the hell?
There's nothing here!
Nothing? -> s5.3

||| s5.3
Yeah take a look
I'll post it up
Wow, you're right -> s5.4

||| s5.4
I didn't mess with any settings
I don't know why its doing this
God I need my team back
I'm sorry... -> s5.5

||| s5.5
They know the inside and out
of everything in this facility
... -> s5.6

||| s5.6
The spectrogram
The E.M.O.R
Every station here had an expert
What's the E.M.O.R? -> s5.7

||| s5.7
Oh, right
I never told you how we got
ahold of the tesseract
Guess not -> s5.8
I was wondering that -> s5.8

||| s5.8
It was floating out in our solar system
Beyond pluto
Oh really? -> s5.9

||| s5.9
Yes and we were lucky we were able
to spot it before any other
space organization
So how did you get it here? -> s5.11

||| s5.11
We designed a machine that harnessed
electromagnetic fields in a way that
space had no way to interfere with
Wow -> s5.12

||| s5.12
We called it: EMOR
Electro-magnetic oscillating rectrator
This let us control the tesseract
and pull it in to Earth
Fascinating -> s5.13

||| s5.13
We had to tweak the machine so that
it condensed the tesseract into a point
so no other agencies could detect it
as it landed
... -> s5.14

||| s5.14
We then reworked the EMOR
For us to conduct tests here
And that's the machine underneath it now
That's fascinating -> s5.15

||| s5.15
That's how we have been inspecting it
and that's how we keep it constrained
when we leave
You condense it down? -> s5.16

||| s5.16
Exactly
That requires constant energy, doesn't it? -> s5.17

||| s5.17
It does, yes
It loves to "stretch its legs"
as we called it when we remove that hold
... -> s5.18

||| s5.18
But for how grand that looks
 you'd be surprised by how little
energy is needed to keep it down
That's interesting -> s5.19
That's funny -> s5.19

||| s5.19
I'm still stumped on the empty sound
Maybe there's nothing else for us to know? -> s5.20

||| s5.20
I'll buy into that for now
I'll open up the final side
But if we get stuck, I'm closing it back up
Sounds good -> end section


||||||||||||| side6

... Are those fingerprints?
It sure looks like it -> s6.1

||| s6.1
...
Are you alright? -> s6.2

||| s6.2
... There are 6 fingerprints
Did I ever mention the size of my team?
You didn't -> s6.3
.. Oh, I'm so sorry -> s6.3

||| s6.3
Why didn't I think of this sooner
It makes total sense
Do you think... -> s6.4

||| s6.4
We stayed under perfect cover...
There was a 0 percent chance
of anyone finding out about this
... -> s6.5

||| s6.5
I'm relieved to say my team isn't dead
But as insane as this sounds
I do think they were abducted
What are you going to do? -> s6.6

||| s6.6
Well, for now we are going to keep
Trying to crack this thing
Are you still in?
Yes -> s6.7

||| s6.7
Thank you...
This, is why I chose you
You're like me and never want to give up
... I think we're close
Do you think they're with the aliens? -> s6.8

||| s6.8
I'm positive those are their fingerprints
We keep them on record
And yeah, they are identical 
Well, now what?  -> s6.9

||| s6.9
...
Let me hop over to Dana's station
One second
Dana? -> s6.10

||| s6.10
Dana was our stargazer
She had the densest documentation
of the cosmosI had ever seen
I see -> s6.11

||| s6.11
Yeah...
Wow... 
What is it?  -> s6.12

||| s6.12
That wormhole...
If we assume that Earth is one of the
Starting points
... -> s6.12.5

||| s6.12.5
The other end points directly to the star
we found earlier too
This is a map!
A wormhole map!
These aliens are really impressive -> s6.13
Dana was really impressive -> s6.13
That sounds scary! -> s6.13

||| s6.13
I'll say
...
Wow...
Are you okay? -> s6.14

||| s6.14
Yeah yeah I'm alright
Lets keep moving forward with this
I'm gonna inspect that sound
See what comes from it
Okay -> s6.15

||| s6.15
Odd, it just looks like a summary
of what we already found
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts
I'll take a look -> s6.16
That is odd -> s6.16

||| s6.16
Thoughts?
Not sure -> s6.17

||| s6.17
- Hey actually you know what
I'm looking at the energy levels
of the sides again and
they have lowered back down? 
Very interesting -> s6.18
What do you make of it -> s6.18

||| s6.18
This does mean that there's room
for more particles
I thought that was impossible, really
I can try some things -> s6.19

||| s6.19
I'd be careful
But go ahead
I'll tweak your machine again
Okay -> s6.20

||| s6.20
I'll be back
I need a break
I'll let you know what I learn -> end section


||||||||||||| rotateMachine

This machine will allow you
To rotate the starting point
by pressing these two buttons
Sounds reasonable -> rm1

I imagine you'll handle it just fine
I'm gonna open up the next side now
Okay -> end section


||||||||||||| spreadMachine

This piece of equipment
Will allow you to change the angle that
the path splits at
Okay -> sm1

Oops!
Sorry about the sparks
I got it added to the system

You know
Something I've been noting
Each of these particles has a unique waveform
I noticed that too -> rp1
